<h2>Overview</h2>
    <h4>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h4>
	<p> Artificial Intelligence is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform
	a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate
	spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations and more. It is focused
	mainly on machine learning and deep learning, used for data processing, natural language
	processing, requirements, interpretation and more. </p>
</section>

<section id="how-it-works">
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <p style="margin-right: 20px;"> In order to learn from the patterns and features 
in the data they study, artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine 
big data sets with clever, iterative processing methods.
Every time an AI system processes data, it evaluates
and assesses its own performance and gains new knowledge.
AI can complete hundreds, thousands, or even millions of tasks very fast since it never 
requires a break. It can learn a lot in a short period of time and become very good at 
whatever it is being trained to do.
However, the key to comprehending how AI actually functions is realizing that it is a 
whole field, or a science, rather than only a single computer program or application.
.
Building a computer system that can simulate human behavior in order to solve complicated issues using human-like thought processes is the aim of artificial intelligence (AI) science.
AI systems use a wide range of methods and procedures in addition to a huge number of 
distinct technologies to achieve this goal.</p>

alt= "Ai working in an office" style="width: 340PX; height: auto;">

</div>
   <p> An artificial neural network is a popular kind of AI training model that is 
somewhat modeled after the human brain.
 A neural network is a collection of synthetic neurons, also known as perceptrons, 
which are computational nodes used for data analysis and classification.  Each 
perceptron in the first layer of a neural network receives the data, makes a 
judgment, and then relays that information to several nodes in the subsequent layer. 
"Deep neural networks" or "deep learning" are terms used to describe training models that have more than three layers.  
There are hundreds or thousands of layers in some contemporary neural networks.  
The neural network's task, such as classifying an object or identifying patterns 
in data, 
is completed by the output of the last perceptrons.</p>

<section id="advantages">
    <h2>Advantages</h2>
	<h3> Eliminates human error and risk </h3>
	<p>
	<img src = "https://kodexolabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Human-Errors-prevention-with-ai-1024x446.webp" 
style= "float:right; width:300px; height:230px"/>

One of the core advantages of AI is that it aids in reducing human error, as well
as risk to humans. It is normal to make mistakes as humans which is not really a problem.
However, when it comes to striving for a complete result, it can be become a big deal. 
Using Ai to complete tasks, can prevent error from ruining an otherwise perfect 
essential product.
Likewise, the use of AI can prevent humans from undergoing difficult or risky tasks that
would likely damage their body systems. Example is a high- radiated area. Unlike humans
that would get seriously sick or even die from the radiation, robots can easily survive
them. If results are fatal, robots can easily be repaired.</p>

	<h3>Unlimited Availability</h3>
	<img src ="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/656ac26f3a3f6e1cc08ba7a5/67fe0a33a2b4ac
d6e7bb2291_671f82bc0b5af201ba9417e4_Benefits%2520of%2520AI%2520in%2520Customer%2520Service.jpeg" 
style= "float:right;height:200px;width:340px;"/>
	<p>As humans, we easily get tired after long hours of work, study or just being
physically active. AI programs, on the other hand, are always available no matter how long
they have worked. They have the ability to provide customer service even outside work hours.
As a result, companies have the ability to develop and provide a better customer experience
than how they usually produce when they are inhabited by only humans. AI chatbots can handle 
countless conversations quickly and efficiently while prioritizing urgent queries. As a result,
humans will be able to handle peak hours without the need for extra hiring, allowing their agents to focus on 
complex issues and high-value interactions  that truly need  a human touch.</p>

	<h3>Unbiased decision making</h3>
<div style= "display: flex; align-items: center;">
<p style="margin-right: 20px;">Humans usually have different opinions which can contribute to the rise of bias
especially within a particular company. When one makes decisions and the other gives a
counterargument, that would lead up to bias of two individuals. 
On the other hand, provided the AI algorithm has been trained using unbiased datasets and 
tested for programming bias, the program will be able to make decisions without the influence
of bias. That can help provide more equity in things like selecting job applications, 
approving loans, or credit applications. 
Though if the AI was created using biased datasets or training data it can make 
biased decisions that aren’t caught because people assume the decisions are unbiased. 
That’s why quality checks are essential on the training data, as well as the results 
that a specific AI program produces to ensure that bias issues aren’t overlooked.</p>

       <h3> Accurate medical diagnosis</h3>
	<img src ="https://assets.clevelandclinic.org/transform/3e9f2415-20c9-45a8-a0ef-4f415008a18a/healthcare-workers-ai-1359494953" 
style= "float:right;height:250px;width:340px;"/>
<p>12,629 clinical claims for medical negligence were filed against the NHS in 2020–2021, a 133% rise from 2006–2007.
 This underscores the urgent need for innovation in the healthcare industry.
Over the last 50 years, medical researchers have made huge advancements in leveraging AI for more accurate diagnosis 
– and treatment – of disease. They have solved integration problems and built upon early rule-based systems to create
 a model that can perform this vital task as accurately as people, if not more so.
Early signs already suggest significant advancements; experts assert that using AI to analyze and examine radiography
and mammography images can speed up the procedure by at least 30 times while maintaining 99% accuracy.
For example: Google’s DeepMind is actively involved in Deep Learning technology to fill gaps across different sectors.
 Part of this initiative – a collaborative effort with Moorfields Eye Hospital – is training a neural network to 
analyse 3D retinal scans to detect more than 50 types of eye disease.</p>

<section id="disadvantages">
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <p>Despite its benefits, AI also have some serious side effects individuals
should be warned about.</p>
	
	<h3>High Unemployment Rate</h3>
	<div style= "display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <p style="margin-right: 20px;">
	The increase of AI- powered job automation raises concern to employees
	of different companies as the technology is slowly taking over industries such as:
	stock markets, healthcare and manufacturing facilities. With AI robots 
	developing, the same tasks would mean fewer humans. Even though AI is set to
	create high amount of new jobs in 2025, many employees will not have developed
	enough skills needed for such roles which would lead to them being fired and later 
	replaced by AI as a company's strategy of making money. <p/>

/macrovector/macrovector1810/macrovector181000745.jpg" alt = "homeless man" width="250"; 
height="180">
</div>

	<h3> Lack of Data Privacy Using AI tools</h3>
	<p>
	<img src = "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/642a58cf800f5885d2a00892/The-12-Biggest-AI-
	Mistakes-You-Must-Avoid/960x0.jpg?format=jpg&width=1440" alt= "warning" style= "float:right; width:350px; 
	height:260px;"/>
	AI tools contain large amounts of data without any regard for security. AI systems like Generative AI, 
	when misused, collect personal data to customize user experiences which are not even secure
	as the technology allows hackers to access an individual's personal account 
	including private information such as password, address, etc, possibly leading
	to data loss. Their ability to process and generate sensitive information can be exploited for malicious 
	purposes, such as phishing or creating convincing spam messages. This became evident when an Large Language
	model was used to craft sophisticated phishing emails that successfully bypassed traditional security filters.
	 This example highlights the need for robust security measures to protect against the misuse of LLMs and 
	safeguard sensitive data.</p>
	<h3> Environmental Impact </h3>
	
        <p>
	<img src = "https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/man-overwhelmed-financial-stress-sitting-desk-covered-bills-
	money-holding-his-head-frustration-generative-ai-328709446.jpg" 
	Alt = "Bills Frustration" style= "float:right; Height:200px; Width:300px;"/>
	While it is true that AI can provide employees with a healthy working environment,
	It can also cause some significant negative impact on the environment. Because
	AI systems rely heavily on electricity, they give rise to excess energy consumption. To make matters worse,
	Ai implementation, as well as adapting an already trained model to a specific dataset demands significant computational resources like
	processing power and memory which is rather expensive to purchase. This can be a barrier 
	for organizations with limited resources or those working on computationally expensive tasks. 
	Individuals with economic hardships are the most impacted because they might already
	be dealing with several challenges like insufficient funds, inflation, with 
	electricity bills thrown in the mix.<p/>

	
	<h3>Over-Reliance of Technology</h3>
	<div style= "display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <p style="margin-right: 20px;">
	When you are over dependent on AI, you are under a risk of losing
	interest in showcasing your talent. For instance, you rely on chatgpt, you end up
	losing your ability to socialise physically with other people. Likewise when a
	company replaces humans with AI, many people begin to lose their jobs because of this 
	which would likely weaken their productivity overtime. Another instance is the
	use of AI in homes. Parents should play a part in their children's lives
	because children typically look up to them and would love to spend time with them. 
	When they rely heavily on AI, the children's development skills might suffer as
	parents depend on technology to take care of their kids for them. AI is not 
	capable of teaching them what is right and what is wrong; moreover, they are not
	as supportive as humans as they disregard a child's safety. Some children might
	begin to feel lonely and eventually lose their eagerness to play around with other 
	kids since they have nobody to depend on even their parents.</p>
	<img src = "https://www.ktdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/
	How-Ai-Can-impact-childhood-loneliness.png" alt = "lonely child with ai" 
	width="430"; height="300">

	</div>
	<h3>Lack of Accountability and Responsibility</h3>
	<p>When an AI system makes a decision, even risky ones, it is difficult to 
	determine who is to blame for damages caused in a particular sector: AI developer,
	company or the technology itself? This lack of accountability becomes a problem in
	certain places like hospitals, banks, etc, where lives are the most impacted due
	to the decisions made.</p>

	<h3>Laziness</h3>
	<p>Since AI is capable of managing any level of task, people become increasingly
	lazy. This is evident among students as AI systems provide them with 
	necessary information about their assigned task. As a result, they no longer make
	enough effort to complete their work, rather they rely on AI to finish their assessments
	for them. This can also be found among companies as employees depend on AI so much
	that they begin to develop a habit of slacking off and ditching work allowing AI to 
	do all their duties. This can also be evident in homes as AI handles house chores
	without a human having to lift a finger.</p>
	<img src = "https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/styles/article_inline_half_caption/public/field_blog_entry_images/2025-03/
	LazyGeniusSyndrome.png.jpg?itok=4w0vPslr" "lazyman with AI working" 
	width="450"; height="380">

	<h3>Ethical Issues</h3>

	<p> Even though AI is capable of making unbiased decisions, it also keeps account of all the biases made by certain companies such as 
	groups of people denied opportunities, misidentified in photos or punished unfairly. When AI systems adopt such behaviour,the offending
	 organization suffers damage to its brand and reputation. At the same time, the people in those groups and society as a whole can 
	experience harm without even realizing it. For example, in a country with higher rates of racism such as United States, the number of 
	employees in any establishment from that country can skew predictive AI algorithms. For example, computer-aided diagnosis 
	(CAD) systems have been found to return lower accuracy results for African-American employees than white employees.
	While artificial intelligence (AI) tools can automate the scanning of resumes during a search to assist find the best applicants, the 
	information that is asked for and the responses that are eliminated might have disproportionate effects on different groups.  For 
	instance, even though the term "ballet dancing" is by no means a necessity for the position, it may draw more women than men to a job 
	posting.</p>
