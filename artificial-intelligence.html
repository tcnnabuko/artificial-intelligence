<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<hr>
<p>Technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, 
decision making, creativity and autonomy.</p>
<p>Applications and devices equipped can see and identify objects.</p>
<p> They can understand and respond to human languages.</P>

<h3>What They Generate</h3>
<hr>

<p>They are used to generate contents like text, images, songs, videos, etc.</p>

<h3>Turing Test</h3>
<hr>
<p>Test that assess a machine's capacity to display human-like intelligence and behavior.</p>
<p>This test was founded by Alan turing in 1950, whose name is based on this test.</p>

<h3>Generative AI</h3>
<hr>
<p>Relies of distribution of data in order for the model to generate new examples related to the dataset.</p>

<h3>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</h3>
<hr>
<p>Involves training a reward model to represent preferences, which can then be used to train other models through reinforcement learning..</p> 

<h3>Fine Tuning</h3>
<hr>
<p>Involves upgrading an already trained AI model in preparation for it's new environment in order for the machine to
adapt to a new task.</p>

<h3>PEAS</h3>
<hr>
<p>P-Performance Measure </p>
<p>E-Environment </p>
<p>A-Actuators </p>
<p>S-Sensors </p>

<h3>Single and Multi Agent</h3>
<hr>
<p>A single-agent system operates independently to accomplish specific tasks.
A multi-agent AI system consists of multiple AI entities that work collaboratively to solve 
complex problems. A multi-agent can be cooperative like a contra game, or competitive like
a street fighter game.</p>
<h3>Fully- Observable and Partially Observable</h3>
<hr>
<p>In fully-observable environments, an agent can observe every aspects of the environment
compared to partially- observable environments where an agent can only observe some aspects
of the environment.</p>
<h3>Deterministic and Stochastic</h3>
<hr>
<p>In a deterministic environment, an agent can predict the possible outcome of it's actions.
In a stochastic environment, unexpected event can happen at any time. </p>
<h3>Static and Dynamic</h3>
<hr>
<p> An agent is said to be static when the environment remains unchanged but actions are still 
being carried out by the agent. Otherwise, the agent is dynamic. </p>
<h3>Constraint Satisfaction Problem</h3>
<hr>
<p>Mathematical problem where values must be assigned to variables and all constraints are to be satisfied.</p>
<h3>Unary Constraints</h3>
<hr>
<p>Only applies to a single variable eg X must be 3, Y can't be 18, etc.</p>
<h3>Binary Constraints</h3>
<hr>
<p>Involves two variables eg X minus Y must equal to 5.</p>
<h3>Higher-order Constraints</h3>
<hr>
<p>Involves three or more variables eg each row in Sudoku must have all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.</p>
<h3>Large Language Model (LLM) </h3>
<hr>
<p>A machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language generation.</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<hr>
<p>AI systems are always available 24/7 to manage tasks even beyond work hours. </p>
<h3>Bias</h3>
<hr>
<p>In a company where bias is the most rampant, AI tools have learned to believe that women are more skilled than men and white people are
more educated than black people.</p>
